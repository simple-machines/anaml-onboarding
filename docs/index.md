# PRODUCT_NAME Onboarding

This guide is designed to get anybody up to speed with the PRODUCT_NAME product.
There should be enough to read and do in this guide to fill at least the first working day of a new starter.

This guide is incomplete, so feel free to raise a pull request for [the repo](https://github.com/simple-machines/anaml-onboarding) if you want to make changes.
This is especially true if you come across any errors not covered by the [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting/setup.md) section.
